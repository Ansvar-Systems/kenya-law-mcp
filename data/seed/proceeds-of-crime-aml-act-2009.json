(6) A court making a restraint order may also make further order in respect of the discovery or disclosure of any facts, including facts relating to any property over which the defendant may have effective control and the location of such property , as the court may consider necessary or expedient with a view to achieving the objects of the restraint order . (7) A court making a restraint order shall at the same time make an order authorising the seizure of all movable property concerned and any other ancillary orders that the court considers appropriate for the proper, fair and effective execution of the order.

(10) When a court orders the rescission of an order authorising the seizure of property in terms of subsection (9)(a) the court shall make such other orders as it considers appropriate for the proper, fair and effective execution of the restraint order concerned.
